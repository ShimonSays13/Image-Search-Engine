# Image-Search-Engine
Creating an Image Search Engine with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

For this application, it uses an image search engine whereby we can search for any image by typing its name and it will display list of images from the stock images that are found from the website Unsplash. Thus this application will be using the Unsplash API to make this image search engine with the help of JavaScript.
